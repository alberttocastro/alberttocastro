Whether it's the latest updates in PHP, the newest software development methodologies, or emerging tech like AI, this dude is always eager to learn more. And it's not just about keeping up with the trends, either. He genuinely enjoy diving deep into the nitty-gritty details of how things work, and he's not afraid to get his hands dirty when it comes to experimenting and testing out new ideas. But even with all his technical prowess, this guy is also a fun-loving, down-to-earth person. He's always up for a good joke or a friendly chat about anything from music to sports to the latest movie. And his Brazilian roots mean that he has a passion for life and a love of celebration that's infectious to be around!

## In progress üèóÔ∏è
If you're here and you see kind of a desolate GitHub profile, please don't judge me. I have a full-time job that takes up most of my time, leaving me with no spare time for personal projects. As a result, my GitHub contributions look like a barren desert. The only green squares you'll see on my profile are from my university projects, and let's face it, that was ages ago. But hey, don't lose hope! I'm still alive and kicking, and if I can find some time, I'm more than willing to consider contributing to some awesome open source projects. So hit me up if you need a code ninja to help you slay some bugs and make your project shine!

## Fun facts ü•∏

- I love Acaraj√©
- Some youtuber programmers I follow (and ones that influence me) are: Gabriel Fr√≥es and Wanessa Weber (Codigo Fonte TV), Felipe Deschamps and Fabio Akita
- Some tech youtubers I follow are: Coisa de Nerd, Tecnoblog, MKBHD and Diolinux
- I preffer the Android side of the force
- I preffer Linux over Windows. But let's be honest: we don't have all tools on Linux. That's why I use WSL, and have the best of both Worlds.
- I'm learning to prioritize, and finish sideprojects I start (nobody is perfect, isn't it?!)
- I like the ideia of working remotely for companies abroad. Do you have a job offer? I'd love to discuss! [Send me an email](mailto:albertto.programmer@gmail.com)
- I'd also love to relocate to another country. What about Canada, or Portugal? My wife and I would pack and go!
