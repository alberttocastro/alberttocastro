### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student and PHP developer. I love technology, and can't stop watching tech reviews. My main stack is PHP (Laravel) and Vue.js.

Here are some of the things I have already come across during my learning path:

- PHP (Laravel, Wordpress)
- Javascript (Vue.js, React)
- Ruby (on Rails)
- HTML
- CSS (SASS, Bootstrap, Materialize)
- Java (Native Android App Development)
- SQL (MySQL)
- C++ (Arduino)

My goal is to keep developing myself as a developer ðŸ¤“. I carry on some projects under the World Digital Code or [wode.dev](http://wode.dev) organization, which I created myself. Feel free to browse around the repos, and give any feedback through albertto.programmer@gmail.com.
