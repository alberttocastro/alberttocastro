### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student @UoPeople and PHP developer. I love technology, and just can't stop watching tech reviews. I'm for remote work and asynchronous communication. I'm from Brazil, BTW.

My main technologies and tools are:

- Javascript (Node, Vue.js)
- PHP (Laravel, Wordpress)
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- CSS, SCSS (Bootstrap, Materialize)
- Git

Some other technologies I've already come across are:

- Ruby (on Rails)
- Java (Android, JSF, Spring)
- C++ (Arduino)
- Visual Basic (Excell)

I'm focusing on developing my skills on Javascript, right now. I'm also building some sideprojects I hope will monetize some day. It will help me to understand the development decisions I should take over time.
I carry on some projects under the World Digital Code or [wode.dev](http://wode.dev) brand, which I created myself, along with a great friend. We carry it as a weekend project. We started by managing a web hosting, developing some websites, and we're also engaged in some Saas projects.
Feel free to browse around the repos, and give any feedback through [albertto.programmer@gmail.com](mailto:albertto.programmer@gmail.com).

The project I'm working right know deals with personal finances. It will be a WebApp first. Then I plan to turn it mobile.
